# AI Agent Demo – Insurance Knowledge Assistant

This project is a public AI agent demo designed to answer insurance-related questions by reasoning over LLM documentation and domain-specific knowledge sources. It demonstrates how modern AI systems can transform complex technical and business documentation into clear, structured, and user-friendly responses.

The system focuses on practical, production-oriented AI engineering, including prompt design, function calling, backend orchestration, and scalable request handling.

## 🚀 Features

- **LLM-Powered Question Answering**  
  Understands and answers insurance-related queries by reasoning over structured and unstructured documentation.

- **Function Calling & Tool Integration**  
  Uses API-based function calling to route requests, validate outputs, and integrate external services when needed.

- **Backend-Oriented Architecture**  
  Separates UI, API, and AI logic for maintainability, scalability, and production readiness.

- **Context Management**  
  Handles conversation state and document context to deliver accurate and relevant responses.

- **Error Handling & Reliability**  
  Designed with validation and fallback mechanisms to ensure stable behavior in real-world usage.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The project is structured as a full-stack AI application:

- **Web UI**  
  User-facing interface for submitting questions and viewing structured AI responses.

- **Backend Service Layer**  
  Handles request routing, prompt construction, function calling, and response validation.

- **LLM Integration**  
  Connects to modern LLM APIs to perform reasoning over documentation and domain-specific knowledge.

This separation allows the system to scale and evolve independently across UI, logic, and AI layers.
